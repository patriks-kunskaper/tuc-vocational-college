# IT-infrastruktur (IT Infrastructure)

**Course Code**: IT-infrastruktur  
**Credits**: 25 YH-credits  
**Institution**: TUC Yrkeshögskola  
**Period**: September - October 2024 (Term 1)  
**Instructor Focus**: Practical virtualization, cloud infrastructure, and security hardening

## Course Overview

Foundational IT infrastructure module covering virtualization technologies, server optimization, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and security practices. The course emphasizes hands-on lab work with Linux systems (Debian), hypervisors (VirtualBox, Hyper-V), and practical security implementations.

## Course Topics Covered

### Virtualization & Infrastructure
- **Virtual Machine Management**: VirtualBox, Hyper-V configuration and deployment
- **Server Architecture**: Resource allocation, system optimization, energy efficiency
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Private vs. public cloud, VM deployment in cloud environments
- **Containerization**: Introduction to container technologies and orchestration

### Networking & Security
- **Network Fundamentals**: ARP protocol review, network segmentation
- **VPN & Secure Remote Access**: PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN comparison; jumpbox/bastion host concepts
- **Security Hardening**: System hardening practices, side-channel attack awareness
- **Firewall Configuration**: UFW (Linux), Windows Firewall implementation

### Risk Management & Resilience
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Security assessment processes and methodologies
- **Backup Strategies**: 3-2-1 backup rule, disaster recovery planning
- **Business Continuity**: Backup and restoration procedures

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Deploy and manage virtual machines across multiple hypervisors
- Configure secure network architectures with proper segmentation
- Implement security baselines following hardening best practices
- Design and execute backup/disaster recovery strategies
- Conduct basic vulnerability assessments
- Differentiate between server platforms regarding security and performance

## Lab Environment

**Primary Platform**: Debian 12/13 on VirtualBox  
**Secondary Platforms**: Hyper-V, Windows Server, Ubuntu Server  
**Network Configuration**: Internal networks, NAT, bridged adapters  
**Security Tools**: UFW, Fail2ban, VPN services

## Assignments in This Folder

### 1. WordPress & MariaDB Lab
Two-VM architecture demonstrating network segmentation, service integration, and advanced security hardening with UFW and Fail2ban. Includes comprehensive risk analysis identifying five security vulnerabilities with mitigation strategies.

**Skills**: Multi-tier architecture, network segmentation, Linux system administration, database security, firewall configuration, intrusion prevention

### 2. ZeroTier VPN Network Environment (Group Project)
Multi-tier secure network architecture built with Debian 13, ZeroTier VPN, and defense-in-depth security controls. Implemented three-server topology (firewall, WordPress/database, backup) with UFW firewall configuration, NGINX reverse proxy with rate limiting, automated backup system using bash scripting and cron, and SSH key-based authentication. Group collaboration project demonstrating network segmentation, NAT routing, intrusion prevention (Fail2ban), and practical system automation.

**Skills**: VPN configuration, network segmentation, firewall administration, reverse proxy setup, bash scripting, SSH security, automated backup strategies, team collaboration

## Study Questions Addressed

Throughout the course, the following strategic questions were explored:

- How can servers be optimized for energy efficiency?
- What resources can be shared between multiple applications on a server?
- How do different server platforms differ in security and performance?
- What does the 3-2-1 backup strategy entail?
- How does vulnerability analysis contribute to better security?
- Why is disaster recovery as important as backup?
- What are the differences between PPTP, L2TP, and OpenVPN?
- How does VPN contribute to secure remote access?
- What is a jumpbox and when is it used?

## Tools & Technologies

**Virtualization**: VirtualBox, Hyper-V  
**Operating Systems**: Debian 12/13, Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, Windows Server  
**Security**: UFW, Fail2ban, VPN protocols  
**Services**: Apache, MariaDB, WordPress, SSH  
**Network Tools**: netplan, ping, ss, iptables

## Competencies Developed

- **Technical**: Virtual infrastructure deployment, Linux/Windows administration, network configuration
- **Security**: System hardening, vulnerability assessment, access control, backup planning
- **Strategic**: Infrastructure design decisions, risk analysis, defense-in-depth thinking
- **Documentation**: Technical reporting, risk documentation, architectural justification
