- **Delivery:** In-person sessions at TUC Sweden + remote components

## Competencies for Career Transition

This course builds baseline technical understanding essential for:
- Security architecture roles (understanding controls and risk frameworks)
- GRC positions (systematic risk analysis methodology)
- Privacy engineering (technical security measures supporting compliance)
- Security advisory roles (translating technical risks to stakeholders)

Combines technical fundamentals with strategic risk thinking and core bridge skills for roles connecting governance & technical implementation.

**Frameworks referenced:**
- ISO 27001/27002 - Information security management
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Risk assessment methodologies

This course establishes core security concepts that underpin later specialized modules and practical application in LIA internships.
