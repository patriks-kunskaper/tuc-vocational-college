# Risk and Vulnerability Analysis: Stockholm Vatten och Avfall

An academic cybersecurity analysis conducted as part of the IT Security Specialist program at TUC Vocational College, Stockholm.

**⚠️ Note: This analysis is written in Swedish and follows Swedish industry standards and regulatory frameworks.**

## 📋 Project Overview

This risk and vulnerability analysis (RSA) examines two critical cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure, focusing on water and waste management in the Stockholm region.

**Analyzed Risks:**
1. **SCADA Cyberattack on Industrial Control Systems** - Threats to water production and wastewater treatment
2. **Ransomware Attack on Administrative IT Systems** - Threats to operations and personal data

## 🎯 Purpose

The analysis is conducted to:
- Meet NIS2 Directive requirements for risk management
- Address GDPR Article 32 requirements for appropriate security measures
- Identify cybersecurity gaps in critical infrastructure
- Propose concrete improvement measures based on MSB regulations

## 🇸🇪 Language & Standards

**Language:** Swedish  
**Regulatory Framework:** Swedish and EU regulations
- NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555)
- Upcoming Swedish Cybersecurity Law (Cybersäkerhetslag)
- MSB (Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency) proposed regulations
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- ISO 27001/27002 (Information Security Management)

## 🔍 Scope

**Regulatory Frameworks:**
- NIS2 Directive (EU 2022/2555)
- Upcoming Swedish Cybersecurity Law
- MSB proposed regulations (MSBFS)
- GDPR (personal data protection)
- ISO 27001/27002 (information security)

**Technical Areas:**

## 🛡️ Key Recommendations

### Risk 1: SCADA Security
- Network segmentation between IT and OT
- Multi-factor authentication for remote access
- SCADA-specific intrusion detection
- Offline backup strategy
- Security awareness training for operators

### Risk 2: Ransomware Protection
- Daily offline backups
- Advanced email security
- Database network segmentation
- Phishing training and testing

## 📚 Methodology

The analysis follows established risk assessment standards:
- ISO 27005
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- MSB guidance for critical operations

**Risk Matrix:** Likelihood × Impact → Severe/Rare for both risks
